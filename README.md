## What is advent of code ?

The Advent of code is a programming advent calendar done by Eric Wastl. It is composed of littles puzzles to resolve and to answer on the website. Because the website needs only the solution, you are able to use any programming language you want.

##How to run the code ?
You should be able to run the code like so :

```
  python file.py
```

No parameters should be necessary. If something is necessary as an input, a README file on how-to should be in the folder.

! WARNING ! The code is only Python 3 compliant. Python 2 is old and dead, let him in peace please.
